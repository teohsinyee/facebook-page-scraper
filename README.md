# facebook-page-scraper
The purpose of creating the scraper is to get basic stats from
https://www.facebook.com/ustazahasmaharun/

Problems:
- Facebook does not provide sorting feature for videos posted by a page
- Unlike YouTube, can sort based on the popularity and counts
- So the most popular videos will have higher visibility
- It makes us (the audience) hard to consume the spiritual materials

- Facebook is a bit buggy, it did not record the 'watched-video'
- So the audience needs to spend time and click in and watch the video again

Impact:
- Find the patterns of which genre of talk will get most attention & reasons behind
- Can add it to my to-watch-list (Spiritual consumes)

Desired output:
- number of reactions
- number of shares
- post url
- post type (video/pictures/text)
